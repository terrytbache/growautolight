### Installing Apache on Raspberry Pi
//Get on to the terminal and update your operating system by typing:

      sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

//When the updates are complete, install Apache with this command:

      sudo apt install apache2 -y

//You can now test that Apache has installed properly by browsing to your Raspberry Pi. If you’re using the Pi’s web browser, type http://localhost.com/ into the address bar.
//From elsewhere on your local network, you will need to use the IP address. If you don’t know this already, you can get it with this command:

      hostname -I

### Congratulations, You Have a Web Server

##Installing PHP
//Adding PHP functionality to Apache requires just one command:

      sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y

//Test whether this works by replacing the index page with one that’s rendered in PHP. Delete index.html and open a new file in nano called index.php.

      sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
      sudo nano /var/www/html/index.php

//Now type this line and then save the file:

      <?php phpinfo(); ?>

//Now reload the page in the browser, just type in the r.pi's ip address into any web browser on the network
